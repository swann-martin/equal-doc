## Why eQual

While being a solid framework that has everything you need to do almost anything, eQual has been designed to oppose as little constraints as possible to developers.

Most frameworks require a long time to master and, while learning them, you might find yourself struggling to achieve simple things.  
With eQual, taking advantage of the native features is entirely up to you.

Actually, since you're reading this, you probably already know everything needed to start using it. So, just use it your way!   


> *What I value the most in eQual is its high level of re-usability and its way of defining controllers by announcing what they do, what they expect and what response they provide, which relieves me from documenting boredom and having to remember everything.*
